    👉 **See Home Assistant’s [Voice Control Guide](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice_control/) for setup.**

### ⏩ **Streaming & Playback Speed**

This component streams audio from OpenAI. Playback starts once the full audio is
downloaded because Home Assistant currently lacks progressive playback support.
You can control the speaking speed via the `speed` option (range
**0.25–4.0**, default **1.0**):

```yaml
service: tts.openai_gpt4o_tts_say
data:
  entity_id: media_player.living_room
  message: "Hello there"
  speed: 1.25
```

> **Requires Home Assistant 2024.5 or newer** for the `speed` option to take
> effect.
